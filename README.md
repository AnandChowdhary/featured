# ✨ Featured projects

This repository contains an API to access my favorite open source projects built by me.

**API:** https://anandchowdhary.github.io/featured/repos.json

## 🙋 How it works

My [✨ Featured projects list](https://github.com/stars/AnandChowdhary/lists/featured-projects) on GitHub is the source of truth for these open source projects. To add new projects to this list, I simply star them and select the "Featured projects" list.

<img width="325" alt="Screenshot of star menu" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2841780/187377130-02ca9e72-2ee3-4d8b-8b1c-2c8dcc269c87.png">

However, since GitHub doesn't have a Stars Lists API (yet!), I wrote a quick script [`update-data.mjs`](./update-data.mjs) that parses the HTML page containing this information, and a GitHub Actions workflow runs every few days to make sure this repository is up to date.
